# Windows-NBD-server
A very simple windows NBD server for study purpose

This is a simple NBD server for Windows, as there aren't information about write NBD server on Windows and on left a NBD protocol document which is
not as informing as it should be. It only has the basic functions needed and can only compliant with linux nbd-client.exe. Most negotiation process 
should be provided and polished. And FYI, this basic skeleton is generated by chatGPT, glue is my most work.
