# Windows-NBD-server
A very simple windows NBD server for study purpose based on asio 1.10.8

This is a very simple NBD server for Windows backing up by a image file, as there aren't information about writing NBD server on Windows, 
and the NBD protocol document is not as informing as it should be. It only has the basic functions needed. The negotiation procedure are 
implemented with nbd-client.exe. And FYI, the framework is generated by chatGPT, focusing on the protocol running is most of my work.

on server, just run :-)
on client:
sudo modprobe nbd
sudo nbd-client -g -N export 172.16.1.100 10809 /dev/nbd0
